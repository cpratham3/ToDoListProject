backend working perfectly fine

tried to run the backend, failed due to

index.html:1 Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:8080/api/tasks' from origin 'http://127.0.0.1:5500' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.

solution
annotating the controller class to enable CORS
@CrossOrigin(origins = "http://127.0.0.1:5500")
